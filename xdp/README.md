# Setup build environment

The code examples in this folder are based on the following open-source projects:

* libbpf
* xdp-tutorial

These are referenced from this repository as GIT sub-modules (cf. `dependencies` folder). To check out the sub-modules, execute the following commands:

```
$ 
```

You also need to install the dependencies as described in the file `dependencies/xdp-tutorial/blob/master/setup_dependencies.org` to build the examples.
